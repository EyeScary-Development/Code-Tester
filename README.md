# Code Tester
A premade code tester library for the web, currently has : HTML, CSS and JS (with very experimental console support)
## Advantages
* Blazing fast (We know, world's greatest cliche)
* Simple
## How to set up:
* Add the files from inside whichever code tester folder you want into your website folder
* When you want to use the code tester, ensure the code is saved to a local storage item named "torun", as well as specifying which language HTML file to go to when you call it (could be through `window.location.href="js.html"` for the JS tester (replace with css.html or html.html for your use case))
* And voila! the code tester will do the rest
